Laravel Auth Router streamlines adding multiple social logins to your Laravel app, saving significant developer effort. Forget complex setups; this package leverages Laravel Socialite to offer a vastly simplified experience.


- __One-Liner Route Setup:__ Instead of extensive controller code and numerous route definitions for each provider, a single line in your routes file can manage login, callback, and logout.
- __Pre-Built Provider Chooser:__ Get an immediate, customizable page on your domain for users to select their login method â€“ no manual UI building required.
- __Rapid Configuration:__ Minimal setup is needed due to a unified route helper and familiar service configuration.
- __Developer Conveniences:__ Includes multi-language support (DE/EN), dark mode for the chooser, and session-based error messages for easy integration into your Blade views.

It automatically handles routing, offers flexible customization for redirects and user registration, and prevents route conflicts, letting you focus on core features instead of auth boilerplate.

## Installation

Install the package with composer:

```bash
  composer require schenke-io/laravel-auth-router
```

## Basic concept

This package includes services and has to be configured in `config/services.php` only.

In the `routes/web.php` file you add the Route helper `authRouter` to define which providers
you want to use and your registration policy.

```php
Route::authRouter(/* provider/s */, $routeSuccess, $routeError, $routeHome, $canAddUsers);
```

| Parameter    | Definition                                                              | Examples                              |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| provider     | name of the social login providers, single string or array of strings   | 'google'  _or_ ['google','microsoft'] |
| routeSuccess | route after successful login                                            | 'dashboard'                           |
| routeError   | route after login failure, should be able to display errors as feedback | 'error'                               |
| routeHome    | route to a non protected view                                           | 'home'                                |  
| canAddUsers  | should unknown users be added or rejected                               | `true` or `false`                     |  

Route names can be same. If the homepage can display errors `routeError` and `routeHome` could be the same.
When the service configuration is not complete not all routes will be created.

## Login and Logout flow

In the app just  link to the `login` route.
It either displays the  selector page, configuration errors or redirect to a single login provider.

For logout just do an empty POST to the `logout` route. Only authenticated users can use the logout.

## Name conflicts

This line:
```php
// routes/web.php
Route::authRouter('google','dashboard','error','home',true);
``` 
registers the following routes when the configuration is free of errors:
- /login
- /login/google
- /callback/google
- /logout

and expects the 3 named routes to be defined: `dashboard`, `error` and `home`.

If this conflicts with other existing routes just prefix it with something:
```php
// routes/web.php
Route::prefix('any')->name('any.')->group(function () {
    Route::authRouter('google','dashboard','error','home',true);
});
``` 

Just use `php artisan route:list` to see which names and routes have been added.





## Configuration

There is no special configuration file, all setup is done over `config/services.php`.


## Errors

The package handles two types of errors differently:

1) setup errors the developer can handle
2) runtime errors which influence the user experience

### Setup errors

The setup errors are shown in the `/login` selector page. 
If you have any errors with your setup, you can fix them in `config/services.php`.
Its mainly missing keys, or missing provider names in `config/services.php`.

### Runtime errors

The runtime errors are stored in a session and can be handled by the app.

| key                    | value                              | language       |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------|
| authRouterErrorInfo    | user message of the error          | localised      |
| authRouterErrorMessage | exception text of the provider/code | english mainly |

The error page could look like:

```bladehtml
<h3>
    {{session('authRouterErrorInfo')}}
</h3>
<p>
    {{session('authRouterErrorMessage')}}
</p>
```



## Example Google login

1) In the `.env` file you have the credentials:

```dotenv
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=24242343242
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=3843430984
```

2) In `config/services.php` you define the service:

```php
// config/services.php
'google' => [
    'client_id' => env('GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID'),
    'client_secret' => env('GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET')
]

``` 

3) in the `routes/web.php` you define the route:

```php
// routes/web.php
Route::authRouter('google','dashboard','error','home',true);

``` 

## Advanced Example

If you want a selection of logins you basically just do:
1) fill the secret data into .env
2) register the services
3) add the route
```php
// routes/web.php
Route::authRouter(['google','paypal','microsoft'],'dashboard','error','home',true);

```
