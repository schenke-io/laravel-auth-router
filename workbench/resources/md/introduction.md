Laravel Auth Router streamlines adding multiple social logins to your Laravel app, saving significant developer effort. Forget complex setups; this package leverages Laravel Socialite to offer a vastly simplified experience.


- __One-Liner Route Setup:__ Instead of extensive controller code and numerous route definitions for each provider, a single line in your routes file can manage login, callback, and logout.
- __Pre-Built Provider Chooser:__ Get an immediate, customizable page on your domain for users to select their login method â€“ no manual UI building required.
- __Rapid Configuration:__ Minimal setup is needed due to a unified route helper and familiar service configuration.
- __Developer Conveniences:__ Includes multi-language support (DE/EN), dark mode for the chooser, and session-based error messages for easy integration into your Blade views.

It automatically handles routing, offers flexible customization for redirects and user registration, and prevents route conflicts, letting you focus on core features instead of auth boilerplate.
